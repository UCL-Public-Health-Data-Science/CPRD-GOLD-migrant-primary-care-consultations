# CPRD GOLD migrant primary care consultations

## Project Description

* This repository contains the code and codelists from the paper 'Migrantsâ€™ primary care utilisation before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in England: An interrupted time series'.
* The coding scripts in this repository were used to clean and analyse the data to produce the results outlined in the paper.

## Data source

Data used in this study were provided by the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). CPRD GOLD data were linked to Office for National Statistics Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) data.  

Researchers can only access this data through a direct research application to the CPRD. 

## Requirements

Code were written in R and are intended to be used in R software with CPRD GOLD data. 
Additional R packages required are detailed at the start of the script.
